# FizzBuzz

I've read that a lot of people applying for junior positions
very often recive a task to write a FizzBuzz. Since it may be
problematic for some people, I did it for you. Here is, The Ultimate
FizzBuzz application, working for numbers from 0 to 9999.

Some haters may say, that it is not useful, since you can not
use internet when resolving this task. It may be true, however
you may just copy source code of this program and write it to
your notebook, then rewrite it manually during interiview.

## What if I don't need that huge range of numbers?

Just delete prints for bigger numbers.

## How to use it?

```shell
python3 FizzBuzz.py
```

## Todo:

- [ ] make it working for numbers above 9999
- [ ] port the application to COBOL
